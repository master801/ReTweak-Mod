# ReTweak-Mod

Info
------------
A 1.7.10 Minecraft mod that (attempts) to load older Minecraft mods ('1.2.5', '1.4.7', '1.5.2', '1.6.2', '1.6.4').<br/>
This uses a ***ton*** of magic and hacks to make it possible.<br/>
**Currently does *not* work.<br/>**
**Do not expect this project to go anywhere soon, if at all.**

**Everything.**<br/>
Currently ***not*** working.

Misconception
-------------
No, this project is not the same as Intermediary by FyberOptic, although the goals are similarly aligned.<br/>
It seems we had the same idea around the same time and they were the one to actually make it possible, albeit for '1.2.5'.

Credit
-------------
FyberOptic - For publicly releasing Intermediary first before this project was even loading.
